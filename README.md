# WRgeochem_ML
Classification of whole-rock geochemistry using machine learning algorithms

This includes a minimum working example to reproduce the machine learning classification of whole-rock geochemistry from Nathwani et al. (2022):
1. Jupyter notebook of code
2. .csv file with training dataset (filtered)

Please contact me if you have any requests for anything I have missed that you would like to reproduce.
